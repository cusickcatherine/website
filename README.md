# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough Git to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the greatest Git tutorial in the history of the Universe. You should totally [check it out](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), and be sure to [join the email list](http://learnenough.com/#email_list).

Michael is suggesting more marketing copy in the tutorial I'm following, but I'm going to replace that with a plug to [follow me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cusickcatherine). ;)
